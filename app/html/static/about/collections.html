  <h2>What you will find in Emblematica Online</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
        This digital library of emblematica contains 1,388 freely accessible facsimiles of rare, and even 
        unique, emblem books from the following libraries: the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; 
        the Herzog August Bibliothek, Wolfenbüttel; Glasgow University, Utrecht University, Duke University, 
        and the Getty Research Institute.  Users can search and browse books from all of the collections 
        named above. (Please see <a href="/help/search-tips">search tips</a>.)
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Granularity of searches</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
        Searches can be conducted at various levels of granularity, that is, at different levels of detail 
        present in our emblem metadata.  Users can search all digital books in Emblematica Online, much like 
        they would in a typical library catalog, according to author, title, and publication information. 
        The advantage of searching for emblem books in Emblematica Online is that users can search across 
        major colelctions of emblematica through a single point of access.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users can also search and browse at levels of granularity below the level of the book from a subset of 
        these books. They can search for individual emblems according to motto, keyword, Iconclass notation, and 
        Iconclass term. Iconclass searches can be conducted in English, German, French, and Italian. All Glasgow 
        (43) and Utrecht (30) books are searchable at the emblem level, while users can search a significant subset 
        of books from Illinois (80) and the Herzog August Bibliothek (35, this number will increase). As a proof of 
        concept, student researchers at the University of Illinois also transcribed the mottos from a small number of 
        books from Duke University (2) and the Getty Research Institute (2) to make them available for searching. 
        Currently, our Iconclass index includes a total of 32,752 distinct Iconclass notations that are searchable 
        and browsable across collections. (Please also see <a href="/help/search-tips">search tips</a>.)

  <h2>Other Digital Collections</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
        Our research partner, Arkyves, the reference tool for the history of culture, also presents searchable emblem 
        picturæ in a broad iconographical context. Significant digital emblem collections are also available at the 
        Universities of La Coruña and Munich that are not part of Emblematica Online, while Penn State University has 
        an independent, tightly focused project on the English emblem.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Physical Collections</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
        Users of Emblematica Online are advised to remember that the digital collections presented here represent 
        selections from much larger physical collections of emblematica. Because emblem books are rare and often 
        fragile, some of them could not be digitized for reasons of conservation and preservation. Owing to limitations 
        on research resources, not all books from all collections could be scanned and/or indexed for Emblematica Online.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main physical collections of emblem books worldwide are held at Glasgow University, the University of Illinois 
        at Urbana-Champaign, and the Herzog August Bibliothek, Wolfenbüttel. There are also notable collections at the 
        Library of the Getty Research Institute, Folger Library, Bayrische Staatsbibliothek (Munich), the Niedersächsische 
        Staats-und Universitätsbibliothek Göttingen, the Bibliothèque Nationale de France (BNF), Bibliothèque de l’Arsenal 
        (Paris), and the Royal Libraries of the Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden, including the library at Skokloster.

  <h1>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
        The physical collections of 730 volumes of rare, and in some cases unique, emblem books 
        in the Rarebook and Manuscript Library are among the best in the world. From these items, 
        <i>Emblematica Online</i>, working in cooperation with <i>Internet Archive</i>, digitized 
        356 volumes from 2009 to 2011. In a new workflow in 2015 the project digitized additional 
        items in house, for a current total of 415 emblem books. Thus the project presents 56% of 
        the collections as full facsimiles.  Users should note that this means that 44% of the 
        collections remain available for their physical inspection at the University of Illinois.

  <h1>Herzog August Bibliothek, Wolfenbüttel</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
        The Herzog August Bibliothek is a worldwide renowned research center for the medieval through 
        the early modern period and Enlightenment.  Emblem books are among their collection strengths 
        with 800 volumes. The HAB digitized 455 volumes, or 56%, of its emblematica collection in the 
        framework of <i>Emblematica Online</i> in 2009-2011. During a new DFG grant 2015-2017 the HAB 
        aims to expand the number of searchable emblems for the Portal. Their collections are 
        particularly strong in seventeenth-century emblem imprints, although all areas of emblematica 
        are well represented. The HAB continues to buy emblem books through the federal German program 
        Sammlung Deutscher Drucke, by which the library is a special national repository for 
        seventeenth-century works.

    <p>
    	The digital collections from the University of Illinois and the Herzog August Bibliothek emerged 
    	from a digital project whose aim was to increase significantly the number of these rare emblem 
    	books available on the Web and to open paths into them with motto transcriptions and Iconclass 
    	metadata.
    </p>
    <p>
    	The projects at Utrecht and Glasgow had entirely different histories and strategies.  Their aim was 
    	to make a significant, tightly focused sub-collection of emblem books available through full 
    	indexing and transcription.  Both projects were launched in 2006. Owing to the <i>OpenEmblem</i> 
    	scholars, a loosely associated group of emblem researchers who consulted and negotiated in a variety 
    	of international forums, starting at Glasgow and continuing through Utrecht, Illinois, and Wolfenbüttel, 
    	we agreed on best practices and standards at a very early stage, and thus strategically positioned 
    	ourselves for the research of the future. Several early meetings were held at Glasgow, where in 2001 
    	Mara Wade expressed the idea of creating and hosting an emblem portal at the University of Illinois.

  <h1>Glasgow University</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
        Two projects completed at Glasgow University, <i>French Emblems at Glasgow</i> and <i>Alciato at 
        Glasgow</i>, are accessible through <i>Emblematica Online</i>. The projects contributed full 
        metadata for a total of 43 volumes of important French emblem books and Alciato editions with a 
        small overlap. While the Glasgow sites contain emblem books from later periods, the strengths of 
        their digital collections lie in sixteenth-century emblematica, French emblems, and Alciato editions. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	The Stirling Maxwell collection at Glasgow University holds over 2,000 items, chief among them emblem 
    	books and iconographical works, from the collections of the nineteenth-century collector Sir William 
    	Stirling Maxwell. Glasgow assumed the lead to develop its existing interest in French material 
    	(supported by generous funding from the Arts and Humanities Research Council) and in Alciato (supported 
    	by funding from the British Academy). Glasgow hosted several early meetings that gave impetus for 
    	emblem research. A third emblem project is also underway at Glasgow for sixteenth-century Italian 
    	emblem books and currently numbers 7 volumes.

  <h1>Emblem Project Utrecht</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
        Twenty-seven Dutch love emblem books, including both religious and secular love emblems, can be 
        accessed here.  Love emblems are a key sub-genre of emblem literature, and all books have full 
        transcriptions, page facsimiles and indexes, as well as extended search options. Links to sources 
        and parallels, translations and annotations continue to be added. The Emblem Project Utrecht is 
        hosted by Utrecht University.  From their home page users can link to educational pages in Dutch 
        and English, download the proceedings from the conference, <i>Learned Love</i>, and visit 
        the on-line edition of Hermann Hugo's <i>Pia Desideria</i> (1624).
    </p>
    <p>
    	Through <i>Emblematica Online</i> students and scholars can now search the books from Glasgow and 
    	Utrecht for related resources in the context of other international emblem book collections, for 
    	example, other editions and copies, translations, and wherever else their research leads them. 
    	Additionally, users can search all individual emblems from the Glasgow and Utrecht books in the 
    	context of related emblems across the portal.  Users can search and browse at the level of the 
    	individual emblem across the Emblematica Online.
