  <h1>Project Description</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
        This project will present emblem books in an innovative digital
        environment and develop a portal for a key genre of Renaissance texts and images.
        Emblematica Online is fulfilling its goals through its three constituent activities: 1)
        Emblem Digitization: the complete digitization of two premiere emblem collections of
        world-wide prominence; 2) The German Emblem Databases: the creation of extensive
        metadata with broad functionality for the German emblems of both institutions in mirror
        websites; and 3) The OpenEmblem Portal: the development of the portal as an open access
        research site incorporating book-level metadata from emblem digitization projects
        worldwide and emblem-level metadata from Illinois and the Herzog August Bibliothek
        (HAB). The OpenEmblem Portal hosted at Illinois will have a mirror portal at the HAB.
        The OpenEmblem Portal offers the ability to search and browse across significant levels
        of granularity, creating functional access to the entire collections of emblem books at
        Illinois and HAB, to book-level metadata for a number of projects worldwide, and to a
        large corpus of emblem-level metadata for German emblems from the collections of
        Illinois and the HAB. Because major search engines such as Google can find the data from
        these projects, the mass digitization undertaken for Emblematica Online will serve
        scholarly communities in Germany, the US, and beyond, for research and in higher
        education.

        The term "semantic web" is so often used that it has almost become a meaningless
        buzzword. That is very unfortunate since a semantic web is exactly what the portal is
        spinning over a unique corpus of early modern imagery and texts. By gathering well over
        10,000 specimens of one of the most popular and widespread art forms of the Renaissance
        and by offering access to its subject matter in unprecedented depth and detail,
        completely new forms of research become feasible. Creating a database of the mottos and
        indexing the meaning of the imagery and the visual means-situations, persons,
        objects-that were used to express it, make possible highly associative searching and
        browsing that by its very nature offers the opportunity of what may be called "knowledge
        discovery." This concept, often used to describe new forms of research that become
        possible when biomedical or chemical data are collected in huge databases such as
        PubMed, will also be applicable to Emblematica Online. The essential analogy is that a
        large quantity of material is combined with sophisticated information about its content.
        Reliable quantitative information will become available about the occurrence of themes
        and motives in artistic and literary sources, a hitherto unknown phenomenon. Scholars
        using this material will no longer have to describe many thousands of images to grasp
        their content; they can devote their energy to new research questions.

  <h1>Methodology and Standards</h1>
  <div class="content">
  <h2>Scanning</h2>
  <p>
    The project will involve digital capture of the
    entire book, cover to cover. The two institutions will scan all emblem books at 300dpi
    in color with an archival copy as JPEG2000 (Illinois) or tiff (HAB). The digital
    facsimiles of all emblem books digitized by the project will be available through the
    on-line catalogues of the respective institutions which also means that all digital
    volumes will be searchable via web search engines, such as Google. <!--The data will also
    become part of the <a href="http://illinoisharvest.grainger.uiuc.edu/">Illinois
      Harvest</a> and the <a href="http://oai.grainger.uiuc.edu/">Open Archives
      Initiative</a>, both at Illinois.-->
  </p>
  <p>
    For presentation on the internet the digital masters are reduced in size and
    converted into JPEGs, which allow researchers to investigate the resource in every
    scientifically relevant respect. At Illinois, the following observations apply. For
    books 14" x 9" or smaller, which represents the greatest part of our collection, we get
    300 dpi or better. At the HAB scanning is carried out by using-depending on the size of
    the original object-either a Canon Marc III (21 Mio Pixel) camera or a Nikon DX2s (12
    Mio Pixel).
  </p>

    Pilot digitization projects have allowed both Illinois and HAB to develop
    digitization standards and gain experience in digital reformatting and quality control.
    Illinois will leverage its ongoing relationship with <a
      href="http://www.opencontentalliance.org/">Open Content Alliance (OCA)</a> with whom
    we have digitized more than10,000 books to date. OCA uses trained staff working on
    custom-designed equipment, follows accepted best practices for setting and verifying
    scanner configurations for each book scanned, and uses sampling-based post-scan quality
    control techniques for all books digitized. Raw scans are saved as JPEG2000 files.
    Technical metadata detailing book-specific camera settings, skew angle, operator, date
    and time of scanning, etc., are saved as machine-readable XML. Checksums for all files
    are generated. Illinois downloads scanned page image files and does additional
    verification of quality as part of creating our added derivatives. While page images are
    captured and archived singly, Illinois has demonstrated the feasibility of stitching
    related page images together, e.g. to make viewable as a single image file all text and
    graphics associated with a given emblem. Such access derivative formats and views
    facilitate identification and use of resources. Illinois provides two digital copies of
    each work; e.g. Meinhard's <i>Geistliche Emblemata.</i> in the <a
      href="http://www.archive.org/details/alphaomegageistl00mein">Internet Archive</a> and
    searchable in the <a
      href="http://www.library.uiuc.edu/contentdm/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/emblems&CISOPTR=2647&REC=8"
      >German Emblem Books Project</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The HAB explicitly declares that the project will be fully compliant with the
    so-called "Praxisregeln" (rules of practice) of the DFG. The library guarantees long
    term availability and reliable quoting. Scanning at the HAB is carried out in-house by
    using the so-called book reflector, or <i>Buchspiegel</i>. It operates at a 45-degree
    angle and was developed to digitize precious and rare books without causing stress or
    damage to the valuable objects during the reproduction process. The HAB has gained long
    experience in in-house scanning in various projects funded by the DFG such as
      <i>Festival Culture Online</i>, <i>Digitization of Scientific, Technical and Medical
      Literature Read by Leibniz</i>, <i>Archaeological Finds in the Early Modern
    Period</i>, and, most recently, the mass digitization project <i>Dnnhaupt digital</i>.
    Currently, more than 5,000 editions of the early modern period with almost one million
    pages are online at the HAB.

  <!--<h3 id="Metadata"><i>Metadata</i></h3>The research teams will create book-level
            metadata from their on-line catalogue and transcribe all emblem mottos. The on-line
            catalogues have already been checked for quality control and will provide accurate data.
            However, in each case the digital copy must be checked against the bibliographic
            description. Some volumes contain several editions that must be carefully differentiated
            in the bibliographic description. While the main goal of the project is access to the
            individual emblem, the project must also provide the context. Therefore, the project
            presents the entire book in which the emblems are contained. We will also provide
            structural metadata for marking-up page numbers, covers, fly leafs, manuscript
            annotations, table of contents, divisions, paragraphs, and illustrations other than
            emblems such as printer devices to navigate more easily through the electronic books. At
            the HAB the project will draw on the structural data list provided by the so-called <a
              href="http://dfg-viewer.de/profil-der-strukturdaten/">DFG-viewer project</a>. <br />
            <br />The HAB will make the necessary structural metadata METS files (containing MODS
            descriptive metadata) to comply with requirements of the DFG book viewer. Illinois will
            also be creating METS files (with MODS) containing structural metadata for all digitized
            books and for the German subset only, but Illinois' structural metadata will be designed
            to work with a different, somewhat less sophisticated METS Navigator from Indiana
            University. We will specially enrich structural metadata detail of our METS files for
            the German subset of Illinois emblem books to be roughly as expressive and detailed as
            those created by the HAB, but meant to work with the Indiana University METS Navigator
            application. Before the end of the project we will analyze samples of the HAB METS files
            against those from Illinois and provide an assessment of what it might take to transform
            ours into DFG viewer compliant METS. Illinois will try to implement the viewer in a way
            that access to the German books through our respective book viewers will be similar, if
            not exactly the same. Illinois will also examine what it might take to transform
            metadata for a book so it could be viewed in either viewer. Both book viewers have
            somewhat similar approaches, and we want to learn more about how they relate.<br />
            <br />The HAB has converted metadata from the Munich emblem project, funded previously
            by the DFG, into the Emblem Schema format; these data are ready to be integrated into
            the OpenEmblem Portal. Professor Dietmar Peil, PI for this project, has placed the
            metadata at the project's disposal (appendix). Further programming and conversion work
            concerning these data will be conducted by the HAB.<br />
            <br />At Illinois, digitized books also will be made discoverable through our Illinois
            Harvest Portal, and metadata describing books digitized will be made available for open
            harvesting through our Open Archives Initiative-Protocol for Metadata Harvesting Data
            Provider. All German metadata from both projects will be made accessible on the
            OpenEmblem Portal. Besides making German emblem books accessible through CONTENTdm, all
            emblem books digitized by Illinois also will be browseable using the METS Navigator
            Web-based application developed by Indiana University. This allows cover-to-cover page
            access to an entire book, with all pages available in both medium resolution and
            high-resolution (near as-scanned dpi) views. Especially for longer works, this allows
            quick navigation to any page while preserving the ability to look closely at any scanned image.<br />
            <br />The German emblem books of both projects will be outsourced for Iconclass notation
            and the creation of a caption. Iconclass is a hierarchical systematic notation with
            multi-language thesauri, thus all metadata from these notations will be available in
            both English and German, as well as other languages. The Iconclass system is available
            on-line in a new version that is being developed into a freely available webservice. All
            projects working in the OpenEmblem group have unanimously approved the classification
            system Iconclass. It is an internationally recognized system for indexing art objects
            and provides a hierarchical depth of indexing appropriate to emblem research. The
            projects expect to index with Iconclass notations in order to provide powerful search
            capabilities via the OpenEmblem Portal. They intend to make the German emblems available
            through book-level metadata (author, title, place, year, publisher), a union catalogue
            of the mottos in a searchable database, and Iconclass, that is emblem-level, metadata,
            from the pictura. This level of indexing will allow scholars to find the research
            materials they need and locate emblem objects for further analysis. Additionally, the
            OpenEmblem Portal will host a database of all book-level metadata for digitized emblem
            books from the universities Utrecht and Glasgow. The transcription of mottos requires
            subject expertise in early modern German, the ability to read old German typeface, and
            the skill to transcribe the early modern German motto and provide a standard German
            translation for searchability in the database.<br />
