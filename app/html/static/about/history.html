			From 2002-2005 University of Illinois and the Herzog
			August Bibliothek, Wolfenbttel, Germany (HAB) received joint funding of
			45,000 Euros as a Transcoop grant from the <a
				href="http://www.humboldt-foundation.de/web/8175.html">Alexander von
				Humboldt Foundation</a>. This grant provided the opportunity to conduct
			the preliminary work leading to the joint proposal for the present project.
			In the framework of the Transcoop project, the University of Illinois was
			able to digitize and create searchable metadata for 19 emblem books. The HAB
			produced digital facsimiles of 46 emblem books. We held <a
				href="http://www.digicult.info/downloads/dc_emblemsbook_lowres.pdf"
				>three independent workshops</a> (one with an associated publication)
			and hosted at Illinois the first ever state-of-the art <a
				href="http://www.conferences.uiuc.edu/conferences/conference.asp?ID=329"
				>conference on emblem digitization</a> in 2005. (Both teams were able to
			leverage this funding to create further support at their respective
			institutions; the University of Illinois generously funded the Seventh
			Triennial Conference of the International Society for Emblem Studies, 2005.)
		</p>
		<p>
			This funding allowed for the establishment of a corpus of digitized
			books, the development of a data structure specific to emblems, and the
			development of 1) a German-English thesaurus, 2) the concept of a unified
			search structure for separately held collections, and 3) a common metadata
			structure. It also led to the creation of an XML structure for emblem
			encoding and of a <a href="http://media.library.uiuc.edu/projects/oebp/"
				>first portal</a> for emblematica. These activities demanded intensive
			research into the respective collections, and resulted in the retroactive
			cataloguing of all emblem books at the University of Illinois that will be
			completed before the end of 2008.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most importantly, the Transcoop grant funded two site visits and three
			workshops on emblem digitization. The HAB research team came to Illinois for
			two weeks, while the US research team visited the HAB for three days before
			an international workshop on emblem digitization. The results of this
			workshop (2003) were published as <a
				href="http://www.digicult.info/pages/special.php">
				<i>Digital Collections and the Management of Knowledge: Renaissance
					Emblem Literature as a Case Study for the Digitization of Rare Texts
					and Images</i></a>, February 2004, by DigiCULT. This grant also
			allowed for the HAB participants to attend the <a
				href="http://www.conferences.uiuc.edu/conferences/conference.asp?id=329"
				>Seventh Triennial Conference of the Society of Emblem Studies</a> at
			the University of Illinois in 2005. Embedded in this conference was the
			first ever state-of-the-art conference on emblem digitization, "Portals,
			Tools, and Data: Conducting Digital Research with Renaissance Texts and
			Images." The first volume of essays resulting from the main conference
			appeared as Emblematica 15 (2007) and received a favorable review in the
			scholarly journals issue of the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>. The second
			volume of essays from this conference is at press and appeared in fall 2008
			as <i>Emblematica 16</i>.

			The third workshop funded by the Transcoop grant at the HAB,
			"Practical Issues of International Emblem Digitization," was held in March
			2007. This workshop strengthened the international ties among recently
			completed projects at the universities of Glasgow and Utrecht and provided
			the opportunity to include new projects in the OpenEmblem group (for
			example, <a href="http://www.bvh.univ-tours.fr/">Universit Francois-Rabelais
				de Tours, CNRS</a>). Related project groups in <a
				href="http://rosalia.dc.fi.udc.es/emblematica/">Spain</a> and <a
				href="http://www.sns.it/it/laboratori/laboratorilettere/testieimmagini/"
				>Italy</a> also expressed their interest in the OpenEmblem research
			group. Of great significance to all participants, especially for the
			workshop organizers from the HAB and Illinois, was to learn concretely from
			the experiences of the Glasgow and Utrecht projects, as well as to consult
			with Hans Brandhorst of <i>arkyves</i> (formerly <i>Mnemosyne</i>). The
			Transcoop grant, funded by the <a
				href="http://www.humboldt-foundation.de/pls/web/wt_show.text_page?p_text_id=1592&p_stencil_mode=1&p_lang=en&p_forum_mode=1"
				>Alexander von Humboldt Foundation</a>, also allowed the HAB to purchase
			a digital camera and a laptop for the project, and funded a part-time
			student researcher at the HAB. Members of the OpenEmblem research group also
			consulted at the Eighth International Conference for Emblem Studies,
			Winchester, England, July 2008, where there was a panel on emblem
			digitization. This triennial conference is sponsored by the <a
				href="http://www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/SES/">Society for Emblem
				Studies</a>.

			The HAB in its Baroque-Document Type Definition project (Barock DTD,
			2000-2002) digitized 38 emblem books (8993 pages), of which 10 imprints
			containing 598 emblems were indexed in-depth. (During the same period
			Illinois digitized 19 emblem books with app. 2,384 emblems and 3,725 pages.)
			The <i>motto</i>, <i>pictura</i>, and <i>subscriptio</i> for each emblem
			were indexed and made accessible in a provisional database. In this
			systematic project the HAB developed basic features of describing and
			indexing emblem books by using current electronic media. While the basic
			unit is the emblem book, emblems were encoded at the level of the individual
			emblem unit. The encoding uses TEI for text and metadata, as TEI best serves
			the purpose of encoding full texts. It also provides for the linking of
			images for convenient access of the digitized facsimile edition of an emblem
			book. For reasons of efficiency a selection of the texts from an emblem book
			was transcribed and keyed in. According to this selection all data and
			metadata to <i>motto</i>, <i>pictura</i>, and <i>subscriptio</i> were
			included in the TEI compliant documents, but not, for example, the prose
			commentary expanding the <i>subscriptio</i>, which can be found in various
			emblem books (e.g. Jakob Bornitz). The encoding allowed for extracting the
			emblem data quite easily. For this purpose a special format (XML-schema) was
			developed, the Emblem Schema, into which the TEI structures can be exported.
			Thus book and emblem information can be seamlessly integrated by using
			different namespaces (TEI and emblem schema). The emblem schema is flexible
			and can also capture emblem data stemming from non-book sources, such as art
			objects, architecture, etc. The emblem schema was used to develop a
			prototype of a union catalogue of emblem mottos. Metadata of mottos from
			projects at the universities Glasgow, Illinois, Munich, and Utrecht, and at
			the HAB were converted to the schema by XSLT scripts and included in a
			database.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another 60 emblem books were added to this first collection in the
			 course of the project funded by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. The
			digitized imprints were catalogued at book-level; owing to limited funds
			there was no emblem-level indexing of the texts, mottos, and picturae in the
			framework of this project. Today there are 96 emblem books online and
			accessible via the HAB website, but only ten of them have metadata
			appropriate for scholarly purposes. All digitized imprints are linked to the
			library central catalogue and may be accessed through web search engines
			such as Google, the emblem database, or other portals. The project thereby
			sets up an infrastructure that allows for multiple points of user access.
			All project components rely on tools and standards that warrant longevity
			and persistence.
