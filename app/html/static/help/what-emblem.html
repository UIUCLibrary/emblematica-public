        The emblem can be considered one of the primary vehicles of cultural knowledge during the 
        early modern period (ca. 1500-1750), capable of expressing highly complex ideas in compact 
        and compelling forms. In the preface to his <i>Companion to Emblem Studies</i> (2006) 
        Peter Daly estimates that ca. 6,500 emblem books were published during the Renaissance, with 
        an individual volume containing anywhere from 15 to 1,500 emblems. Appearing in both Latin 
        and the vernacular, emblems were integral to the print and material culture of Renaissance 
        and Baroque Europe. Emblem books were published and widely circulated, treating every possible 
        sphere of early modern knowledge: ethics, natural philosophy, politics, science, religion, 
        love, war, and everyday life.

        Because emblem books treat all aspects of life and culture, they are ideal subjects for 
        interdisciplinary historical research. They offer a key to understanding the early modern 
        period, ca. 1500-1750, in European culture and provide a treasure trove of texts and images 
        still popular in the contemporary social imaginary.  For example, the proverb “Love is blind” 
        has many emblematic expressions, and many such texts and images are recognizable today in 
        contexts from advertising to other forms of media.

        The canonical emblem can be defined structurally, and often is, as a tripartite composition 
        consisting of a brief motto in Latin or a European vernacular language (<i>inscriptio</i>), an 
        enigmatic picture (<i>pictura</i>), and an epigram (<i>subscriptio</i>, Figure 1). This definition 
        works fairly well, until scholars and students start to encounter forms that do not have all three 
        of these parts, but are nevertheless clearly emblems. To the initiated, even brief allusions to an 
        emblem were often sufficient to generate the memory of an entire emblem complex in the minds of 
        readers. Scholars and students might also encounter so-called “nude” emblems that consist only of text 
        and have no pictura.  Any part of the emblem can be absent which makes learning what an emblem 
        is confusing to beginners. Experience helps. Once users become accustomed to the special interplay 
        between texts and images that characterizes the emblem, distinguishing an emblem becomes easier. 
        Thus while the structural definition of an emblem is a useful starting point, students of the emblem 
        realize that a more complicated definition is helpful.

        The hybrid forms of the emblem present an argument composed of words and pictures. Thus, another way 
        to define the emblem is as a process of reciprocal reading of texts and images, whereby the back and 
        forth between the words and the pictures creates meaning. The picture presents the reader with a 
        recognizable scene or symbolic collage, and the text then reorients the reader’s understanding of 
        that scene to present a new and unexpected message. More than the sum of their parts, emblems involved 
        innovative reading practices combining words and images. They redirected readers’ thinking, and were 
        intended to change their perspective, for example, to produce new insights, to make political, social, 
        ethical, and religious commentary, to make a joke or a pun meaningful, and to juxtapose visual and 
        textual meanings, thereby creating new knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
        While the relationship between the texts and picture can be relatively straightforward, it is too 
        simplistic to say that the pictura illustrates the texts or that the motto and epigram explain the 
        meaning of the image.  Emblems consist of a special kind of play on meaning among its parts to create 
        significance. The emblem is a compact and concise hybrid genre that depends on the intersection of 
        meaning across texts and images. It also exploits the tension between overlap and separation in the 
        connotation of words and pictures.  Emblematic strategies permeated the early modern world and are 
        important resources for study of the period.  They open a window on the attitudes and mentalities of 
        the early modern world.  They are also fun, and emblems are still created today.

        The genre began with the publication in 1531 at Augsburg of <i>Emblematum Liber</i> by the Italian jurist 
        Andrea Alciato, and in the following centuries the individual emblem often expanded from a single page or 
        opening of the book to lengthy, often multi-lingual, text-image constructions consisting of multiple mottos 
        and numerous paratexts that could include poetry, prose commentaries, marginalia, sermons, references to the 
        liturgical year, and other literary and devotional texts. Layouts with multiple emblems on a page or emblems 
        spanning multiple page-openings also emerged over time (Figure 2-X). During the 16th and 17th centuries, 
        leading authors and artists worked with printers and publishers to produce emblem books on topics ranging 
        from natural history and politics to love and religion. The genre of the emblem is therefore always the work 
        of an ensemble. Emblem production was not limited to the printed page, and ‘applied emblems’ were painted, 
        carved, and etched both onto decorative objects, such as tankards and furniture, and into architectural spaces, 
        including churches, town halls, manor houses, and hospitals. Emblems were enacted in the theater, and they 
        embellished court pageants and funerals. At a time when national languages were developing their particular 
        literatures in the wake of Renaissance humanism, emblems explored the meanings of adages and proverbs. 
        Familiar texts and images were reassembled to create new meanings.

        Given the widely dispersed nature of the physical emblem books, their often rare and fragile condition, and their 
        necessity to the informed study of the European Renaissance, digital emblematica are of particular interest to 
        scholars. Today, the study of emblems informs multiple academic domains, spanning disciplines such as art history, 
        cultural history, literature, semiotics, political science, musicology, and religious studies. The surviving 
        exemplars of early modern printed emblem books are geographically widely spread, with half a dozen libraries in 
        Europe and North America holding the primary research corpus.
